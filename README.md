# CKD Prediction

    <p>Chronic Kidney Disease(CKD) is the gradual decline in the filtering capacity of the kidneys.
    Thus the prediction and prevention of kidney diseases become vital.</p><br>
    <p>Feature selection is the process of selecting the most relevant set of features from a larger set of features. Feature selection increases the predictive capabilities ofnthe Machine learning models and also reduce the cost of computation.</p><br>
    <p>In this project, Boruta Feature Selection and Random forest feature selection were compared by training the ML models on the subsets of features that were selected by the techniques.</p>
    ML models used are:
    * K- Nearest Neighbour (KNN)
    * Logistic Regression
    * Gaussian Naive-Bayes(NB)
